**Key features include:**

**• Creating Personalized Learning Paths**: Users can easily create their own learning paths by setting clear goals and breaking them down into smaller, achievable steps.

**• Progress Tracking**: The application saves all user progress, providing a comprehensive view of the user's learning journey at all times.

**• Save and Load Functionality**: Users can save and load learning path templates. This feature allows users to create their own roadmaps and share them with others, facilitating the exchange of experience and knowledge between users.
