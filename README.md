# RoadMap For Learning Activities

## Overview
RoadMap is an application designed to help users create and manage personalized learning paths for various topics. The tool allows users to define sections, set checkpoints, and track their progress towards specific goals.

## Key Features
- **Create New Roadmaps**: Users can create a new roadmap by specifying the name, author, sections, and checkpoints.
- **Upload Existing Roadmaps**: Users can upload pre-existing roadmaps and start tracking their progress immediately.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track your progress through various sections and checkpoints.
- **Customizable Sections**: Add or remove sections and checkpoints as needed to tailor the roadmap to your needs.
- **Deadline Setting**: Set deadlines for your roadmaps to stay on track and achieve your goals within a specified timeframe.

## Future Plans
1. **Compatible with a wide range of operating systems**: Adding support on MacOS and Linux. Possibly also on mobile operating systems.
2. **RoadMap's browsing**: Adding a UI to interact with a large number of RoadMaps at once.
3. **RoadMap editing**: Edit the RoadMap after it has been created.

and so on... **:)**
