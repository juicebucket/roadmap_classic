### Future Plans
1. **RoadMap's browsing**: Adding a UI to interact with a large number of RoadMaps at once.
2. **RoadMap editing**: Edit the RoadMap after it has been created.
3. **Checkpoints description**: Allow users to enter additional information for each checkpoints (like links, describing the element and etc.) 

and so on... **:)**
