## Overview
**RoadMap** is an application designed to help users create and manage personalized learning paths for various topics. The tool allows users to define sections, set checkpoints, and track their progress towards specific goals.

## Key Features
- **Creating new roadmaps:** Users can create a new roadmap by specifying title, author, topics, topic descriptions and subtopics.
- **Uploading Existing Roadmaps:** Users can upload other people's existing roadmaps and start tracking their progress immediately.
- **Tracking Progress:** Track your progress on various tracks with an easy-to-use and intuitive user interface.
- **Edit already created maps:** Edit your goals already after creating a roadmap.
- **Customise lines:** Add and delete ‘sections’ as needed to customise the roadmap to your needs.
- **Set deadlines:** Set deadlines for your roadmaps to stay on track and achieve your goals within the specified timeframe. Application will notify you of upcoming deadlines.

## Project History and Future Plans

Initially, RoadMap was developed as a course project. After reaching version 0.6.0, I decided to split the project into two branches: Classic and Master.

- **Classic branch:** Preserves all the features and stability of the original version (v0.6.0).
- **Master branch:** Dedicated to the continuous improvement of the application, introducing new features, optimizations, and better user experience.
The main version will evolve with major updates, including structural changes and new features that would be difficult to implement in the Classic version without affecting its stability. While the Classic branch will receive occasional bug fixes, this master branch is where future innovations will thrive.

If you encounter bugs or issues, please report them in the issues section, specifying if they pertain to this version.
